        <div class="text ">
          <p>The Magdalena river basin lies in one of the thirteen <i>páramos,</i> or moorlands, of the Colombian Massif, located in the south of the administrative department of Huila. The indigenous and farming communities of the region know it as the "Womb of Mother Earth", and before journeying there, an entire spiritual ritual must be offered up. It is from this basin, one of the more than 360 that can be found in the Massif, that <b>the Magdalena River is born, Colombia's principal fluvial corridor, and one that crosses the country from near the border with Ecuador all the way to the Caribbean Sea. Its 1,540 km, from start to finish, are all part of the same stream, the same body of water. This same body, however, has in recent decades been broken, cut and mutilated by a dozen hydroelectric dams.</b> By the year 2030, according to the projections of Colombian government and its <i>development drivers,</i> there will be seventeen electricity-generating cement walls installed in the Magdalena.</p>
          <h3>Luz Myriam used to be a small-scale fisherwoman, and her daily work completely depended on the health of the Magdalena's wider ecosystem.</h3>
          <p>Luz Myriam Restrepo lived for many years on, with, and from the river. The waters of the Magdalena were her way of life and her home. Like hundreds of other residents of the municipalities of Gigante and Hobo, in the heart of the department of Huila, Luz Myriam was a small-scale fisherwoman, and her daily work completely depended on the health of the Magdalena's wider ecosystem. The economy of the region, immersed in a community and rural lifestyle characterized by self-sufficiency, depended mainly on fishing and farming activities.

            <div class="text">
          <p>When Luz Myriam began her fight against the construction of the hydroelectric facility that the far-right president Álvaro Uribe Vélez (2002-2010) had announced in her area, her children were three and ten years old. <b>In spite of years fighting to prevent the construction of this extractivist mega-facility in her capacity as a community leader with the Association of People Affected by the El Quimbo Hydroelectric Project (ASOQUIMBO), in 2011 Restrepo was forced to witness the inauguration of the dam, with Italian and Spanish capital provided by the companies ENEL and ENDESA under the Colombian trade name of ENEL-EMGESA.</b> This inauguration brought with it the flooding of 8,500 hectares of rural land, with more than 28,000 people affected and some 15,000 forcibly displaced. A wall of environmental, economic and social upheaval had been erected in her region.
          <br><br>
          A development model founded on extractivist principles has imposed activities such as open-pit mining, fracking, extensive monoculture for agrofuels, and large hydroelectric facilities on rural areas of Latin America, with all the negative consequences that these entail for local communities. "The government said the dam would be an exemplary development initiative for the local area, that it would create many jobs, that people would have a better quality of life... none of that happened", says Luz Myriam. "Quality of life is not making us go hungry, destroying our families, uprooting us from where we live”.

                            <h3>For the past four years, Luz Myriam has been cleaning houses in the city of Neiva, the capital of Huila. "I started working in a family home where I came in at six in the morning, left at seven in the evening, and earned 400,000 pesos (€110) a month.”</h3>

            <p>"The launch of the El Quimbo construction project brought about the total destruction of small-scale fishing, what with the digging work, the chemicals that were dumped, the trees that were cut down... the fish either left or, if they didn't, died off", the fisherwoman explains. The 95,430 square metres of cement brought the connection between local communities and the river and natural environment to an end, and forced them to move to urban areas where, in the case of Luz Myriam and so many other women, they have been forced almost by default into the care work economy. For the past four years, Luz Myriam has been cleaning houses in the city of Neiva, the capital of Huila. "I started working in a family home where I entered at six in the morning, left at seven in the evening, and earned 400,000 pesos (€110) a month. The hardest thing is knowing that I used to be self-employed and now I have to go work for others, people who are upper-class and who treat you badly", complains Restrepo. With this salary, which is equivalent to less than half of the Colombian minimum wage, it is impossible to travel every day from her local area to the city. Transportation costs 70,000 pesos per round trip, and it can take up to two hours to get to Neiva, so making the move to the city –whether one wishes to or not– is inevitable.

                  "These extractivist initiatives not only remove materials, or natural resources, which is the term they use," explains Luis Eduardo Barrios, an ASOQUIMBO activist. <b>"They also destroy the social fabric of the population, they remove their link with the land and their livelihoods, which are no longer the same after these initiatives get under way”.</b> Indeed, Luz Myriam's way of life –like that of so many rural, indigenous and Black people who are continually forced to migrate to the city due to the consequences of a development model imposed by a colonial capitalist system– has changed absolutely in that <b>it has moved away from a community-focused outlook of family care and subsistence, to an individualistic and commercialized paradigm that creates novel needs and alienates basic care practice. </b> </p>
              <h3> The enemy is "a multinational monster... a capitalism that is now in its most ruthless, most unhinged, and most destructive phase”. The fight is on "for land, for water and for life itself", says Barrios.
              </h3>
              <p>"We've been forced to beg and humiliate ourselves before other people and it shouldn't be like that, because here –on the banks of the Magdalena– we never wanted for anything, we had everything. Now I come home exhausted, I barely have time for my kids, and then it's off bed...because you have to keep up your routine. It's a very cruel life", laments Luz Myriam, who on many occasions has had to delegate the care of her children to her mother. Eight years after construction, ASOQUIMBO's struggle against the El Quimbo dam goes on, and they are now calling for its immediate decommissioning. "We're fighting against extractivist energy policy, this is our struggle: to raise a voice against all these projects that destroy the land, break the supply chains, violate human rights, and destroy the environment", says Luis Eduardo Barris. According to the activist, the enemy is "a multinational monster...a capitalism that is now in its most ruthless, most unhinged, and most destructive phase”. The fight is on "for land, for water and for life itself", says Barrios.

        <p>
        Consuelo Canchala was born in October 1983 in the Los Robles neighbourhood of the town of La Sierra, in the south of Cauca. <b>La Sierra is one of the core settlements of the Colombian Massif, also known as the Estrella Hídrica or "hydro-star",</b> from whose mountains and moorlands emerge five of the largest rivers of Northern Latin America, among them the Caquetá, the Cauca and the Magdalena. These rivers flow into the Amazon Basin, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, making <b>this significant water source one which provides Colombia with 70% of its drinking water.</b></p>
        <h3>According to citizens' organizations in the Colombian Massif such as <i>Proceso Popular y Campesino de La Vega Cauca,</i> more than 30,000 hectares of the land are subject to mining licences granted to multinationals such as the South African Anglo Gold Ashanti or the Canadian Continental Gold.</h3>
        <p>Consuelo's place of birth, therefore, is a land of lush waters where minerals and gemstones also abound. According to citzens' organizations in the Colombian Massif, more than 30,000 hectares of the land are subject to mining licences granted to multinationals such as the South African Anglo Gold Ashanti or the Canadian Continental Gold. For this reason, Consuelo and the rural community to which she belongs, together with the indigenous community of the Yanacona people (of which her husband, Hernán Palechor, is a part), have come together to act as guardians of the Massif and the common resources it contains. These ancestral communities, spurred on by their presence on this land, their traditional resilience based on a harmonious relationship with nature, and their low-intensity agricultural and farming activity, have come together to defend their way of life and their territory.

        <p>
          However, the modern-day colonial-capitalist system and its Eurocentric development model has, for many decades, uprooted these guardian communities of the Estrella Hídrica and forced their displacement to urban areas. At the age of twelve, Consuelo Canchala, like her six siblings, had to leave Los Robles for the first time in order to continue her secondary education. </p>
          <h3>“My childhood was idyllic, I spent it all in the countryside where we could play out in the open”, she explains. "When we left to study it was very traumatic, being away from my father and my mother was terrible.”</h3>
          <p>Having turned 18, despite the obstacles she faced as a woman from a modest rural background, and with her daughter Andrea in tow, she and her partner Hernán tried to make a living as agricultural workers. However, “my husband went to do military service –in Colombia, it's for 18 months– and it was up to me to look after my daughter. <b>So, I left home to work for the first time, taking care of another girl the same age as my own. That was terrible, leaving my little girl in the care of my mum and dad",</b> remembers Consuelo. Being away from Andrea was the only option on several occasions, "because of the lack of financial resources: <b>there's no work for you as a woman in the countryside,</b> for men there is, but for us there isn't". As a result, she had to "go to the city to look for work, for opportunities", she says. "I left out of necessity".

          <p>Consuelo and Hernán spent several stretches away from their daughter before finally settling down in Cali, where all three have been able to live together. Public transport from La Sierra to the third largest city in the country costs about 40,000 pesos, so family visits ended up being infrequent, while life in Cali remained tough: "I was working from six in the morning till six in the evening, and my husband was going between day shifts and night shifts. So my daughter pretty much grew up alone”. Perhaps as a result, along came Samuel, an energetic and active boy who's grown up largely under the wing of his sister Andrea. She, about to turn 18, is happy whenever she returns to La Sierra, where she takes part when she can in the work of the Yanacona Indigenous Defenders and the Indigenous Guard, an age-old community body keeping watch over the land and those who live there.</p>

                <p>With things being as they are, as a result of <b>a developmental model which makes rural self-sufficiency increasingly difficult, creates insecurity in agricultural work and destabilizes economic opportunities in rural areas, lays waste to a community-based way of life,</b> posits to the city as the best place to live, and points to professionalism as the only path to <i>social success,</i> thousands of people and families have been thrust into moving to the great metropolises of Latin America. From 1960 to the present-day, the continent's rural population has declined from 55% to 20%. In Colombia, moreover, the violence of an armed conflict that has gone on for more than 100 years and continues to this day, and the uprooting of entire communities, have seen the nation placed at the head of the ranking of countries suffering the most forced displacement.
                </p>
                <h3>"I would like to fix it [the ranch] up: I like the countryside, and I don't want to stay here in the city.”</h3>
          <p>
            There are several factors, then, that deny Colombians the right to remain in their place of birth. Andrea Torres, from the Tierra Digna Centre for Social Justice Studies, asks from Bogotá: "Who is this <i>development</i> supposed to 'develop'? What we see in indigenous communities, in Black communities, in rural communities, is that no discernible 'development' takes place”. Consuelo Canchala now works providing care to a middle-class family in Cali, 230 km –about five hours– from Los Robles. "I would like to return to my home, to my land. I have a small ranch there, I would like to fix it up: I like the countryside, and I don't want to stay here in the city", she says. This goal, however, is a major challenge, and is hampered by a system that promotes the city ahead of the countryside, concrete ahead of the earth, and cultural deracination ahead of the permanence of the land.
